extrapolation testing:
extrapolation_burger_pinns.mat
	u_pred1: testing predictions of pinns
	u_true: ground truth of testing data obtaining from liangliang
	v_values: v values of testing data
	x: positions 0-1
	t: times 0-3s

interpolation testing:
interpolation_burger_pinns.mat
	u_pred1: testing predictions of pinns
	u_true: ground truth of testing data obtaining from liangliang
	v_values: v values of testing data
	x: positions 0-1
	t: times 0-3s

note: in this .mat file, it concludes 5 testing data, and they are the same. The reason why I repeat one testing data is for running the code for convenient. So if someone plot the predictions, only plotting the first data is okay.
